            <h2>I'm from Tucum√°n, Argentina</h2>
            <p>In my work experience I acquired many skills, such as team management, group management, work under
                pressure, result-oriented work, having specific goals of time and results, creativity and proactivity, but now I am
                looking for the challenge that changes my life and take me to another level of experiences, growing and learning
                every day.<br/>
                I am a proactive person and also autodidact, always looking for a way to improve and complement my knowledge.
                Not knowing is a temporary state if you have the initiative.</p>
